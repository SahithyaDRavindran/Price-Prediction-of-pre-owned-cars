# Price-Prediction-of-pre-owned-cars

Case study: predicting the price of pre-owned cars. Unlike classification like classifying it under categories, here we are predicting the value. With the help of creating a model, we can predict the prices of the car.

Filename: cars_data.csv
Dataset size: 50,000 X 19  - 19 attributes among which one is the dependent variable.

Here the dependent variable is the price variable.

Things which we have to be done are,
		1. Identify if the data is clean.
		2. Check if the data is having any missing values.
		3. Then we look for variables variables influencing price and identify the relationship between the variables using correlation, scatter plot, etc.
		4. Identify outliers using central tendency measure, box plot, etc.
		5. Then look if categories with meagre frequencies can be combined so that we can combine it into a compact one.

Method Identification:
		1. Linear regression.
		2. Random Forest
